Open the folder you ran `jam3-programmatic-animation-lesson` in your editor of choice. There you'll see a folder called `1- Why animation at all`. In that folder you'll see a `practice` and `solution` folder. Inside the `practice` folder go ahead and create a solution. If you need to "cheat" you can always take a look at the `solution` folder.
